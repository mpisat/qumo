# Configuration for qumo relay server

server:
  # Address to bind the relay server (QUIC/MOQT)
  address: "0.0.0.0:4433"
  
  # TLS certificate files
  cert_file: "certs/server.crt"
  key_file: "certs/server.key"
  
  # Health check HTTP endpoint (optional)
  # Used by load balancers and Kubernetes for health/readiness probes
  # Endpoints: /health, /healthz, /ready
  health_check_addr: ":8080"

relay:
  # Number of group caches to keep in memory
  # Higher values use more memory but reduce cache misses
  # Default: 100
  group_cache_size: 100
  
  # Frame buffer size in bytes
  # Should match your typical media frame size (e.g., 1500 for network MTU)
  # Default: 1500
  frame_capacity: 1500

# SDN auto-announce (optional)
# When configured, this relay will automatically register received
# moqt.Announcements with the SDN controller's announce table.
# Other relays can then discover which relay holds which track.
# sdn:
#   url: "https://sdn.example.com:8090"
#   relay_name: "relay-tokyo-1"  # defaults to relay.node_id if omitted
#   heartbeat_interval_sec: 30   # re-PUT interval (default: 30)
#   tls:                         # optional mTLS for relay→SDN
#     cert_file: "certs/relay.crt"
#     key_file: "certs/relay.key"
#     ca_file: "certs/ca.crt"
