   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/qumo.git
   cd qumo
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:

## Development Workflow

### Creating a Branch

Create a feature branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/` for new features
- `fix/` for bug fixes
- `docs/` for documentation changes
- `refactor/` for code refactoring

### Making Changes

1. Make your changes in logical commits
2. Write clear, descriptive commit messages
3. Follow the existing code style
4. Add or update tests as needed
5. Update documentation as needed

### Commit Message Format

We follow the conventional commits specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Example:
```
feat(relay): add connection pooling support

Implement connection pooling to improve performance
when handling multiple concurrent streams.

Closes #123
```

### Testing

Run tests before submitting:

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...

# Run tests with race detector
go test -race ./...
```

### Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions and idioms
- Use `gofmt` to format your code
- Run `golangci-lint` to check for common issues:
  ```bash
  golangci-lint run
  ```

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. Update your fork with the latest upstream changes:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. Push your changes to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. Create a Pull Request from your fork to the main repository

4. Fill out the PR template completely

5. Wait for review and address any feedback
